# App Service Plans

## Query Pattern

### Linux (use InstanceCount for multiple instances)

ServiceName: Azure App Service
SkuName: P1 v3
ProductName: Azure App Service Premium v3 Plan - Linux
InstanceCount: 2

### Windows

ServiceName: Azure App Service
SkuName: P1 v3
ProductName: Azure App Service Premium v3 Plan

## Key Fields

| Parameter     | How to determine           | Example values                     |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `skuName`     | App Service Plan tier+size | `B1`, `B2`, `S1`, `P1 v3`, `P2 v3` |
| `productName` | Includes plan tier and OS  | See below                          |

## Cost Formula

```
Monthly = retailPrice × 730 hours × instanceCount
```

## Notes

- App Service Plans are billed whether or not apps are running on them — deleting all apps does not stop billing; delete the plan itself
- Multiple apps can share one plan; cost is per-plan, not per-app
- Windows plans omit the OS suffix in `productName` (e.g., `Azure App Service Premium v3 Plan`); Linux plans append `- Linux`
- Free (F1) and Shared (D1) tiers exist but are not recommended for production and may not appear in all regions
- **Functions on Dedicated plans** (B1/S1/P1v3) are billed entirely through App Service — no meters appear under `Functions`; see functions.md
- **Logic Apps Standard** creates WS-type App Service Plan resources in the portal, but billing flows through `Logic Apps` meters — not App Service; see logic-apps.md
- Private endpoints require Basic tier or higher
