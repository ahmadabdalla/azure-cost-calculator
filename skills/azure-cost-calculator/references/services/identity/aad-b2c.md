# Azure Active Directory B2C

> **Trap**: Do not confuse with `Microsoft Entra ID` (per-user licensing, no API meters) or `Azure Active Directory for External Identities` (B2B guest users). B2C is CIAM for consumer-facing apps with per-MAU or per-authentication billing.

> **Trap (sub-cent tiered pricing)**: All tiered meters return sub-cent rates; the script displays zero cost and its `totalMonthlyCost` sums all tiers producing a meaningless number. Use the Known Rates table and calculate each tier bracket separately with progressive pricing. Do NOT report zero cost to the user.

## Key Fields

| Parameter     | How to determine                    | Example values                                                                                |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `serviceName` | Always `Azure Active Directory B2C` | `Azure Active Directory B2C`                                                                  |
| `productName` | Single product                      | `Azure Active Directory B2C`                                                                  |
| `skuName`     | Billing model: MAU or per-auth      | `Standard`, `Basic`                                                                           |
| `meterName`   | Authentication type or MFA add-on   | `Standard Monthly Active Users`, `Basic Authentication`, `Basic Multi-Factor Authentication`  |

## Meter Names

| Meter                               | skuName    | unitOfMeasure | Notes                                      |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `Standard Monthly Active Users`     | `Standard` | `1/Month`     | Current MAU model, 50K free, tiered above |
| `Basic Authentication`              | `Basic`    | `1/Month`     | Legacy per-auth, 50K free, tiered above   |
| `Basic Multi-Factor Authentication` | `Basic`    | `1`           | Per-attempt flat rate for SMS/Voice MFA    |
| `Basic Stored User`                 | `Basic`    | `1/Month`     | Always zero at all tiers, tracking only   |

## Cost Formula

```
Standard MAU:  Billable = max(0, totalMAUs - 50,000) then apply tiered rates progressively
MFA add-on:    Monthly = mfa_retailPrice × mfaAttempts
Legacy auth:   Billable = max(0, totalAuths - 50,000) then apply tiered rates progressively
Total:         Monthly = MAU_or_Auth_cost + MFA_cost
```

## Notes

- **Free grant**: First 50,000 MAUs/month (Standard) or 50,000 authentications/month (Basic) are free. Does not apply to free trial, credit-based, or sponsorship subscriptions
- **Two billing models**: Standard (per-MAU, current default) and Basic (per-authentication, legacy pre-Nov 2019); switch to MAU is irreversible
- **P1 vs P2**: The API has a single `Standard` SKU; per-MAU pricing is identical. P2 features (Identity Protection, PIM) were retired from B2C tenants on March 15, 2026
- **MFA is per-attempt**: Each SMS/Voice MFA challenge incurs a charge whether sign-in succeeds or fails
- **End-of-sale**: As of May 2025, not available for new customers; new implementations should use Microsoft Entra External ID
- Related services billed separately: `identity/entra-id.md` (Microsoft Entra ID), `Azure Active Directory for External Identities` (B2B)
